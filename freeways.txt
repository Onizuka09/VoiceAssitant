üîπ About Free Software

Free software refers to programs that respect the freedom of users to run, study, modify, and share them. 
It is defined by four essential freedoms:

1. Freedom to run the program for any purpose.
2. Freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to your needs (requires access to source code).
3. Freedom to redistribute copies to help others.
4. Freedom to improve the program and release your improvements to the public.

The philosophy behind free software is not only about cost (free of charge) but mainly about **freedom**. 
It allows communities like FreeWays ISI to learn, collaborate, and build technology together while sharing knowledge openly.
